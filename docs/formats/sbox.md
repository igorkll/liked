# sbox - simple box
unlike .box, it does not install likedbox but the likeOS kernel before unpacking.
this format is the "likeOS" installation file.
essentially an archive in tar or afpx format.
when installed on a disk via liked, the selected disk will be completely erased, "likeOS (kernel only)" will be installed there and this archive will be unpacked.
